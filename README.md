# odin-recipes
Hello, this is my first project in my journey to complete the Odin Project foundations course. By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated how to: make paragraphs and headings in HTML, make text bold and italic in HTML, run the HTML boilerplate, and add images and links to my text. # odin-recipes
